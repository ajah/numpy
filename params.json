{"name":"Numpy","tagline":"Numpy main repository","body":"NumPy is the fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python. \r\nThis package contains:\r\n\r\n    * a powerful N-dimensional array object\r\n    * sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\r\n    * tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\r\n    * useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. \r\n\r\nIt derives from the old Numeric code base and can be used as a replacement for Numeric. It also adds the features introduced by numarray and can be used to replace numarray.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found at the website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.numpy.org\r\n\r\nAfter installation, tests can be run with:\r\n\r\npython -c 'import numpy; numpy.test()'\r\n\r\nThe most current development version is always available from our\r\ngit repository:\r\n\r\nhttp://github.com/numpy/numpy\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
